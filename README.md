# LSBA-Sofia-Student-Hackathon-2024

Welcome to my React-Vite project for the Sofia Student Hackathon 2024!

## Project Overview
This project is designed and developed by me for an organization named **LSBA (Let Sofia Breathe Again)**. LSBA’s mission is to tackle air pollution in Sofia through innovative architectural solutions. The goal of this web app is to provide a visually appealing, modern experience that encourages users to submit interest forms and enables organizations to reach out for potential collaboration.
